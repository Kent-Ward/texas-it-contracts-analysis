# 🧠 Analyze Phase Completion Checklist — Texas IT Contract Awards Project

This document summarizes the full scope of work completed during the **Analyze** phase of the Texas IT Contract Awards Data Project using Python.

## ✅ 1. Prepare Phase Summary
- Cleaned and standardized all raw Excel files
- Combined `solicitation` and `no_solicitation` datasets
- Added and cleaned key fields:
  - `contract_type`, `status`, `project_name`, `nigp_codes`, etc.
- Created `refined_master_tracker.xlsx` with two sheets:
  - `solicitation`
  - `no_solicitation`

## ✅ 2. Key Questions Answered

### 📌 Q1: Which agencies award the most contracts?
- Output: `top_agencies.xlsx`
- Grouped by `agency/texas_smartbuy_member_number`
- Visual: Bar chart

### 📌 Q2: Who are the top vendors?
- Output: `top_vendors.xlsx`
- Grouped by `vendor_name`
- Visual: Bar chart

### 📌 Q3: What is the average contract value?
- Output: `contract_value_summary.xlsx`
- Used `po_amount` column to calculate mean, median, total

### 📌 Q4: Which tech categories have the most opportunities?

- Output: `tech_trend_summary.xlsx`
- Visuals:
  - ✅ Bar chart (used)
  - ❌ Pie chart (rejected due to readability issues)

### 📌 Q5: How does contract awarding vary over time?
- Used `award_date` → `award_month`
- Output: `award_trends_by_month.png`
